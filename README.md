# DME 

This analysis aims to evaluate the performance of a recommender system that carries out cuisine classification and ingredient prediction.

1. Software / packages needed: see 019_requirements.txt file.
2. Data is stored in: `019data` folder
3. How to run the scripts:
- Run the notebooks in ascending order (019_1. to 019_.4) 
- For 019_4.Ingredient Prediction:
    - Run all the cells in order. Computation takes time. The function run_test is run in the same cell as as its definition.
    - You could change the parameter N to reduce the number of samples for less computation time. Notebook was run again to check #functionality.
